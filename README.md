# The Phi-graph
Welcome to this ambitious project, that is the phi-graph.

This is a public repository where I am sharing my work on the creation of a framework combining all of science into one single graph.

## What is it?

The Phi-graph (or Î¦-graph) is a graph that relates all scientific models together. In this graph, the nodes can be one of two types, a variable or a model node. Variable nodes are only allowed to be connected to model nodes and vice-versa.

## How to use it?

The simplest use for the phi-graph is solving a general problem, with an unknown variable.

- Step 1: Gather all the known variables.
- Step 2: What is your unknown variable?
- Step 3: Identify each of those variables in the Phi-graph.
- Step 4: Choose a subgraph that is bounded by only the known variables and the unknown variable. No additional leaves are allowed.
- Step 5: Executing the correct operations, let the graph flow from the known variables to the unknown variable, through the model nodes.

## Why is this important?

This graph represents the first part of the Phi-framework that aims to formalize all of humanity's scientific knowledge. This is motivated by current state of the scientific community. Today, scientific disciplines operate in isolation, preventing breakthroughs that require interdisciplinary collaboration. Additionally, this separation allows for many inconsistencies between theories of different disciplines. This, in turn, leads to lack of trust from the general public, as well as within the scientific community. The Phi-framework aims to resolve these issues by unifying every discipline together, requiring self-consistency as basis.
