--Categorization--

- Origin: How each equation or relationship is derived.
	E = Experimental: Relationships or equations derived from experimental observations or empirical data, including heuristics and rules of thumb.
	M = Model: Based on theoretical models or simulations that describe a phenomenon, including approximations that simplify complex relationships.
	D = Definition: Fundamental definitions that are universally accepted in the field.
	T = Temporary: Provisional equations or relations used in specific contexts or under certain assumptions.

- Relationship type:
	E = Equation (equality between two expressions).
	I = Inequality (greater than, less than relations).
	M = Membership (set memberships, e.g., element belonging to a set).

- Structure:
	D = Differential
	A = Algebraic
	I = Integral
	F = Functional

- Provenance:
	S = Self
	O = Other
	C = Child
	P = Parent
	U = Universal

- Specific Number: Identifies the specific relation or family of relations within the subdomain.

- Version: Specifies revisions or alternative forms of the relation. You can leave this out if only one version exists at present.

- Dimension: Specifies the dimensions of the variables (0 - scalar, 1 - vector, 2 - matrix, ...)
